# Cube Solver App

## Overview
An Android application developed with Kotlin that scans a Rubikâ€™s Cube and computes the optimal solving sequence. It presents the solution in a clean, interactive UI.

## Features
- Captures cube face colors using the device camera
- Locally computes optimal cube-solving algorithms
- Displays step-by-step solving instructions

## Planned Features
- Improving local solving algorithm
- Improving UI to be more intuitive
